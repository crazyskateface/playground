# JavaScript Learning Playground 🚀

A hands-on learning environment for understanding and re-implementing complex JavaScript systems from scratch.

## 🛠️ Quick Start

Create a new learning project:

```bash
npm run create-project
```

The generator will ask for a project name and type, then scaffold everything you need to start learning.
